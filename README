This is a minimalist ROOT file reader that will iterate over file and store requested observables
in dataframe, similar to lheAnalysis. Uses DELPHES output trees.

Features:
- Will produce 2D dalitz plots for all observable combinations
- Can easily add arbitrary new observables in ROOTreader.py
- Will store computed dataframes to improve speed next time doing cuts/plots

Future:
DONE - add better logic for signal specific backgrounds
DONE - parallelize object initialization

- improve speed by using iterators
- check stored dataframe contains all requested observables - ifnot then compute extra columns and append
- add errors - statistical and from cuts (binomial)
- Combine lhe and ROOT analysis, make cutNplot shareable 
- lheReader and ROOTreader should just be creating and storing dataframes alongside metadata (in hdf5)
- add support for hdf5 and compressing files, which stores ROOTdata metadata along with dataframe
